If you get the error "requests.exceptions.SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool" That means either you dont have internet or the connection was blocked by a firewall

The first round has a preround length of 44 seconds but depending on wifi you migh load in later so for the first round you will press the hotkey when the clock hits 30
(or for spike rush, 10) For the 12th round the clock starts at 44 seconds so the program keeps track of the round you are on. So at the end of the game, you need to click on the button to reset rounds.
